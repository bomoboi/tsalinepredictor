# tsalinepredictor

This is a proof-of-concept predictor and simulator for TSA lines in the continental US. In it's current iteration, the predictor and simulator are limited to the top 10 airports.
The files in the tsascript folder can be used to scrape the TSA FOIA records for throughput and add them to an external database that can be integrated with the django site in the tsasite folder.
